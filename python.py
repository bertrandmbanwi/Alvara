""" 
I'll use Python and Flask for implementation, as they are widely used and offer a simple way to create a web service. Here is an example implementation:

"""

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from datetime import datetime

app = Flask(__name__)

def parse_date(date_string):
    return datetime.fromisoformat(date_string)

def date_ranges_overlap(range1, range2):
    range1_start = parse_date(range1["start"])
    range1_end = parse_date(range1["end"])
    range2_start = parse_date(range2["start"])
    range2_end = parse_date(range2["end"])

    overlap_start = max(range1_start, range2_start)
    overlap_end = min(range1_end, range2_end)

    if overlap_start < overlap_end:
        return True, {"start": overlap_start.isoformat(), "end": overlap_end.isoformat()}
    else:
        return False, None

@app.route('/overlap', methods=['POST'])
def check_overlap():
    data = request.get_json()
    range1 = data.get("range1")
    range2 = data.get("range2")

    overlap, overlap_range = date_ranges_overlap(range1, range2)

    response = {"overlap": overlap}
    if overlap:
        response["range"] = overlap_range

    return jsonify(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
